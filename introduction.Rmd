# Introduction

We live in an era of rapid environmental change, with multiple drivers of ecosystem processes shifting simultaneously (climate, CO2, nutrient deposition, pollution, species introductions, habitat destruction) and continuously. Because of this the natural systems that we seek to understand, manage, and conserve are in a period dominated by transient conditions and will continue to be so for the foreseeable future. In the face of this change there is an urgent need for ecologists and other environmental scientists to be able to better understand and predict both these transient dynamics and their long-term implications (Dietze et al. 2018). Fortunately, we are aided in this endeavor by an increasing volume, variety, and velocity of environmental data (LaDeau et al. 2017, Farley et al. 2017, Shiklomanov et al. 2019) as well as increasingly sophisticated models (Fisher and Koven 2020, Fisher et al 2018). In other words, while we face unprecedented challenges, we also have unprecedented capacity to address those challenges.

As the variety of data available increases it is often the case that there are multiple types of data available to constrain our understanding of ecological processes, state variables, and/or model parameters.  Sometimes these are alternative ways of measuring the same thing (e.g. field versus remotely sensed estimates of leaf area). In other instances they are observations of different parts of a coupled problem. Most ecological processes are complex, and thus ecological models in general, and mechanistic models in particular, often need to predict multiple interacting variables, such as different species, life-history stages, demographic processes, or biogeochemical pools and fluxes. In both of these cases, there is information to be gained through _data fusion_ -- the use of multiple different data types to constrain a single model. Using multiple constraints is often essential; very often no single data type provides us with a complete understanding of a process.  We need to confront different parts of a model with different observations to make sure we are getting the right answer for the right reason, and have not just calibrated a model to produce the "right" answer for one variable through a series of compensating errors (Medlyn et al. 2015)

In principle data fusion is conceptually straightforward. When writing down a statistical Likelihood for either a frequentist (maximum likelihood) or Bayesian model, one writes down multiple data models that are are connected to the same underlying process model. In practice, there are a number of places where things can go awry (Zipkin and Saunders 2018, Zipkin et al. 2021). One particularly common challenge is the need to combine unbalanced datasets, where one or more data types is available in a much larger volume than the other data constraints. This frequently occurs when combining low-volumes of manually-collected field data with high-volumes automatically-collected data collected either from in situ sensors or via remote sensing. For example, in studies of the terrestrial carbon cycle there is often two orders of magnitude difference or more imbalance between the number of measurements available from automated measurements such as eddy covariance data and manual measurements such as soil and plant carbon stocks.

A common observation when combining unbalanced data is that the outputs from data fusion (e.g. calibrated model parameters) are virtually identical to the results achieved by fitting the model to the high-volume data by itself.
Since each data point is usually modeled as an independent piece of
information in a Likelihood, the influence of the sparse observations can often be overwhelmed by the higher frequency data (**Cameron et al in review 2018**). 
In essence, the data fusion ignores the low volume data, which gets swamped out by the much larger sample size of the high volume data.
Needless to say, this can be disappointing as the lower-volume data often represents considerable labor and, as noted earlier, is often collected to ensure that the model is getting the right answer for the wrong reason. 
As more and more data becomes available this issue of extremely imbalanced datasets is likely to worsen significantly. For example, NASA's earth observation system is expected to grow by an order of magnitude, from an already overwhelming ~5PB/yr in 2018-2020 to a staggering ~50PB/yr, as soon as 2022 (https://earthdata.nasa.gov/eosdis/cloud-evolution).

To add insult to injury, it is also often the case that the addition of high-volume data can cause the predictions for other, low-volume output variables to perform worse. **For example.. <<add examples>>.**


In response to data fusion gone awry, a number of _ad hoc_ solutions have been employed. For example, one might simply thin the high volume data until the data constraints are more balanced (**CITE + example**). Another common solution is to average the data over time or space, for example by aggregating high-frequency sensor data up to a daily, monthly, or annual number.

**Richardson, Moore, Riciutto << add more examples >>**

**Williams et al 2009** "Temporal error correlations (systematic biases) are likely to be severe between sub-daily fluxes, for models and observations. To handle this data redundancy, one can include error correlations in R (a rather difficult task), sub-sample the whole data set, or use a mean diurnal cycle over a relatively long period (Santaren et al., 2007)."

[@MacBean2016] has a review of existing multiple constraint studies ***

While neither of these approaches is technically wrong, they are definitely disappointing, as they involve throwing out data which results in a loss of information. Another option that has been employed is to apply weights to the different data models within the overall Likelihood, with the most common option being to down-weight the high-volume data so that the different data models are more balanced. 
For example, Medvigy et al 2009 constrained the ED2 model to nine data constraints, including eddy covariance at the annual, monthly, and hourly scale and forest growth and mortality data, and weighted each part of the likelihood equally.
[@Keenan2013a] similarly weighted each dataset equally when calibrating the FÃ¶BAAR model to 16 distinct data constraints.
[@Thum2017] constrained ORCIDEE with multiple constraints, weighting each by sample size.
[@Richardson2010c] calibrated the DALEC model by optimizing the product of the log-Likelihoods across six data constraints, which similarly weights all data sets as equally important but doesn't have any basis in probability theory. 

Weighting likelihoods has the intuitive appeal of retaining every observation, but it has the more subtle issue of not being grounded in probability theory, which is the basis for both Likelihood and Bayesian statistics. Mathematically there's also nothing stopping one from 'upweighting' datasets, which amounts to pretending that you have more data than you actually do, leading to falsely overconfident parameter estimates and predictions. As a point of fact, in all of these options (thinning, averaging, weighting) the choices made shift not only the mean, but also have large impacts on the parameter uncertainties and model confidence intervals.

The big problem with these approaches, whether thinning, averaging, or weighting data, is that they are all very subjective. There is a full continuum of options available, from working with data at its raw frequency all the way up to averaging all the data to a single point, and the outcome of the analysis will change, often dramatically, depending on the averaging/thinning/weighting one chooses. Indeed, practitioners are resorting to thinning/averaging/weighting precisely because it changes the outcome, but there's currently no objective advice on how to do so.

One possible path forward is to look for a more objective way to weight data.
In this regard, some have pointed to the "independence" assumption and suggested that greater attention needs to be paid to the information content of a dataset (Dietze 2017). Spectral analyses of high-frequency environmental data, such as eddy covariance, often show distinct peaks at the annual and daily scale, reflecting strong seasonal and diurnal cycles (Dietze et al. 2011, STOY CITE). In such cases aggregating data that's at a high frequency (e.g. 1 observation per minute) to 5 minute data will retain almost the same information content but the sample size will be cut by five. While aggregating is ad hoc, formally accounting for non-independence of observations, for example by accounting for autocorrelation in a Likelihood, is not (**CITE Examples**). Because modeling spatial and temporal autocorrelation can be computationally demanding, others have sought to approximate this by weighting data models based on calculations of effective sample size (Fer et al. 2018).

While autocorrelation is probably part of the challenge of working with high-volume data, there's reason to believe that its not the only issue at hand. For example, autocorrelation doesn't explain why calibration to a high-volume dataset would cause a model to perform worse at predicting a different output variable. Also, many high-volume data sources have little to no replication. For example, is an eddy covariance tower that produces 17520 half-hourly observations per year count as n=17520 data points or n=1 tower? If there were a whole population of sensors we could calculate a sample mean and variance. There is every reason to believe that any one sensor will be different from the mean, but with only one sensor there is no way of knowing what the mean is or how different the data we have is from that mean.

The goal of this paper is to use simulated data experiments to identify more clearly the different issues associated with fusing unbalanced data in parameter calibration. We aim to develop a general methodology for identifying whether and where the issue becomes a problem, and then to start to explore simple modifications to the Likelihood to see to what extent they can help ameliorate the identified issue. For these simulated data experiments we developed a very simple process-based ecosystem model (VSEM) as a testbed. Our aim is to present a model that simple enough that results are easily understood, but sufficiently complex that we can be confident that the model/data issues identified here would also been seen in more complex/realistic process-based ecosystem models. By calibrating the model to variations of it's own output (with added observation error), we are able to experimentally separate the influence of unbalanced data in the calibration from the influence of artificially-introduced errors in the data or the model. Overall we find that model and data errors appear to be at the root of many of the issues attributed to unbalanced data. However, it is the presence of multiple constraints, and the power that comes from high-volume data, that together shine a light on errors that otherwise often go unnoticed. Because all models are wrong (but some are useful), simply "fixing the model" is not always sufficient given the statistical power big data provides. We show that simple fixes that account for model and data bias can lead to improvements in prediction, but point to the need for research.
